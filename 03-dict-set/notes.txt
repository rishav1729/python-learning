# dict[key_name] vs dict.get[key_name]

dict_name[key_name]: This is the standard method of accessing the value for a given key_name in the dictionary. 
                     If the key is present in the dictionary, it will return the value associated with that key. 
                     However, if the key is not found, it will raise a KeyError.

dict_name.get(key_name): The get method is a safer alternative to the standard method. 
                         It allows you to access the value associated with key_name, but if the key is not found, 
                         it will return None instead of raising an error. You can also provide a default value that 
                         will be returned if the key is not found, like this: dict_name.get(key_name, default_value).
